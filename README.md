# Train





###This project is a Java implementation of a train simulation, during my studies as a __Java Developer__ - as an excercise by my Instructor (https://csc.gr). 

The simulation models a train traveling along different tracks with multiple stations. While developing, I had to practice by adding and removing, trains on tracks, traincars on trains, passengers from the train and stations as also a timetable schedule. The simulation involves console prints that displays the current state of the trains and stations. 

The project uses object-oriented programming principles to model the train and stations as objects with properties and methods. The code is organized to improve readability and maintainability. The project was developed using native Java
